## RAG Pipeline Design – Step-by-Step

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system first ingests and indexes documents, then retrieves relevant context at query time and augments an LLM with that context to generate accurate answers. In practice, a typical RAG pipeline follows these stages: ingest data → index (embed) → retrieve relevant chunks → generate output. For example, Pinecone’s RAG diagram illustrates these steps: documents are parsed and split into chunks, each chunk is embedded and stored in a vector DB; at query time, the user question is embedded, the vector store returns top-matching chunks, and those chunks + question are fed into the LLM to generate a response. This architecture leverages external data (via the vector DB) to ground the LLM’s output, reducing hallucinations and improving domain-specific accuracy.

Below are the recommended steps and components for an open-source, scalable RAG pipeline on your infrastructure (4×A100 GPUs, Kafka, Kubernetes).

### 1. Document Ingestion & Conversion
- **Handle diverse formats**: Use document parsers to convert any input format (PDF, Word, HTML, Markdown, etc.) into text. Tools like Docling or Unstructured can parse many file types into a unified text representation. For scanned PDFs or images, apply OCR (e.g. Tesseract, EasyOCR) to extract text. Ensure all text is in English (per your requirement) – you could drop or route non-English content.
- **Data connectors**: Employ Kafka Connect or custom ingestion services to feed incoming documents into the pipeline. For example, a “document-in” Kafka topic could receive file paths or raw content; a parsing service consumes this topic, invokes the parsers (Docling, Apache Tika, etc.), and outputs raw text or JSON to a “parsed-doc” topic.

### 2. Preprocessing & Chunking
- **Clean and filter text**: Remove extraneous content (headers, footers, page numbers, boilerplate) so that the LLM sees high-quality context. For example, Unstructured’s pipeline suggests deleting “UncategorizedText” (noise like page numbers or irrelevant fragments) to improve LLM performance. Also normalize whitespace, fix OCR errors, etc., since “garbage in, garbage out.”
- **Split into chunks**: Break each document's text into overlapping chunks that fit the LLM’s context window. Small chunks generally improve retrieval (“smaller chunks tend to enhance retrieval quality”), but too small can lose context. Experiment with chunk size and overlap (e.g. 500–1000 tokens per chunk with 10–20% overlap). LangChain’s text splitters or LlamaIndex’s splitter utilities can help. Each chunk should also carry metadata (source document ID, page number, etc.) for provenance.
- **Hierarchical/smart splitting**: Optionally use structured splitting (like Docling’s hierarchical chunker) so that headings/sections stay intact in chunks. This preserves semantic boundaries.

### 3. Embedding Model & Vectorization
- **Generate embeddings**: Use a high-quality open-source sentence/embedder to convert each chunk to a vector. Popular choices include Sentence-Transformers models (e.g. all-MiniLM-L6-v2, hkunlp/instructor-xl) or even using an open LLM (LLaMA2, Mistral, etc.) as an embedding model. These models output continuous vectors that capture chunk meaning. Embedding quality is crucial: poor embeddings hurt retrieval.
- **Batch and GPU acceleration**: With 4×A100 GPUs, run the embedder on GPU and process chunks in batches for speed. Use frameworks like Hugging Face Transformers or SentenceTransformers to do batched inference.
- **Indexing parameters**: Record each embedding along with its chunk metadata. Typical settings are cosine or inner-product similarity and float32 (or float16) vectors. Keep track of vector dimensions (e.g. 768 or 1536) since the DB schema needs it.

### 4. Vector Database (Milvus vs Chroma)
- **Choose your vector store**: Milvus and ChromaDB are both open-source vector databases, but with different strengths. Milvus is a distributed, production-grade system that scales to billions/trillions of vectors and supports GPU-accelerated indexes, high-throughput search, RBAC, partitioning, etc.. Chroma is a lightweight, single-node store optimized for ease-of-use and datasets up to ~1M vectors. Given all-document ingestion and 4×A100 GPUs, Milvus (which can leverage multiple GPUs and Kubernetes pods) is likely more future-proof and high-performance, whereas Chroma is simpler to deploy if your data is smaller.
- **Set up the DB**: On Kubernetes, deploy Milvus (e.g. using the Milvus Helm charts) or run Chroma in a container. Configure storage (persistent volumes) and compute (assign GPUs for indexing/search if available). Define collections or tables for embeddings, with metadata fields (e.g. chunk_id, doc_id, original text snippet).
- **Index type**: Choose an index (HNSW, IVF, etc.) balancing speed and accuracy. For example, Milvus supports GPU-based IVF or HNSW indexes. If low latency on large corpus is needed, use GPU indexing.
- **Insertion pipeline**: After embedding each chunk, the embedding service should upsert the vector into the DB. This can be done via client libraries (PyMilvus for Milvus) or a Kafka consumer: e.g. emit embeddings to a “embeddings” topic, and have a Milvus writer service consume from it to load vectors into the DB.

### 5. Query Processing and Retrieval
- **Embed the query**: When a user query arrives, first convert it to the same embedding space as the documents. Use the same embedding model (or a compatible one) and settings.
- **Vector similarity search**: Query the vector DB (Milvus/Chroma) for the top-k nearest neighbor chunks (by cosine or inner product). These are the most relevant passages for the query. Typically k might be 5–20 depending on the model’s context window. This is your retriever component. For better accuracy, you can also consider a hybrid approach (e.g. BM25 + vector) or a reranker, but dense retrieval alone often suffices.
- **Assemble context**: Collect the retrieved chunk texts (and metadata) and prepare a prompt that includes them. A common strategy is to prepend a system prompt like “Use the following context to answer:” and then list the chunks, followed by the user’s question. This augmented prompt format combines the question with retrieved facts. As LangChain notes: “a ChatModel/LLM produces an answer using a prompt that includes both the question with the retrieved data”.

### 6. LLM Generation (Open-Source Models)
- **Choose an open LLM**: Use a local, open-source LLM (no paid API). Options include LLaMA 2 (Meta, up to 70B), Mistral (7B, 8×7B, 22B), Falcon, or other open models on Hugging Face. With 4×A100 GPUs, you can run larger models (13B or 70B with model sharding/quantization) or multiple smaller ones. You might also use instruction-tuned variants (e.g. Mistral-7B-Instruct) for better Q&A performance.
- **Deployment**: Containerize the model using frameworks like vLLM (for high-throughput serving) or Hugging Face’s accelerate/Triton for multi-GPU parallelism. You can split one large model across GPUs or run several smaller-model workers. Ensure the LLM service can consume requests (prompts) from Kafka or an API gateway.
- **Prompt and generation**: At query time, send the augmented prompt to the LLM to generate the answer. Tune generation parameters (temperature, max tokens, top-p) according to your needs. Remember: the answer quality depends heavily on the context – a strong retriever means the LLM has good facts to work with. Poor context yields poor answers, so focus on retrieval first.

### 7. Infrastructure, Scalability & Orchestration
- **Kafka for decoupling**: Use Kafka as the event bus between pipeline stages. For example, have topics like `docs`, `parsed-docs`, `chunks`, `embeddings`, `queries`, `answers`. Each stage is a microservice:
    - Ingestion service consumes raw documents from `docs`, outputs parsed text to `parsed-docs`.
    - Chunker service reads from `parsed-docs`, splits into chunks, sends to `chunks`.
    - Embedder service reads `chunks`, generates vectors, publishes to `embeddings`.
    - Indexer service consumes `embeddings` and writes them into the vector DB.
    - Query service listens to a `queries` topic (user questions), produces answers to an `answers` topic after retrieval+generation.
    This event-driven design ensures scalability and fault tolerance: each component can scale horizontally (multiple instances on Kubernetes) and Kafka buffers spikes. As Kai Wähner describes, Kafka’s high-throughput, low-latency messaging and Flink-like stream processing let RAG access up-to-date context and scale independently.
- **Kubernetes microservices**: Containerize each component (parsing, embedding, indexing, LLM inference) and deploy to Kubernetes. Use GPU node pools for embedding/LLM pods, and standard nodes for Kafka/connectors. Configure autoscaling (e.g. more LLM pods if GPU usage <100%). Use PersistentVolumes for Milvus storage. Kubernetes ensures isolation, easy updates, and resource management.
- **Parallel processing**: With 4 GPUs, you can run several embedding or inference threads in parallel. For example, run two embedding pods each using 2 GPUs, or run a data-parallel LLM across all 4 GPUs. Optimize batch sizes to fully utilize GPU memory.
- **Monitoring & logging**: Track queue lengths, latencies, and errors at each stage. Use logs/tracing to debug pipelines. Tools like LangChain/Smith or custom logging can help trace a query through retrieval to generation.

### 8. Evaluation and Tuning
- **Quality checks**: Regularly evaluate the RAG system on a QA dataset (real or synthetic) to ensure answers are accurate. Metrics like retrieval precision and answer F1/EM can guide improvements. If performance is lacking, adjust hyperparameters: chunk size/overlap, number of retrieved chunks, embedding model, LLM prompt formatting, etc.
- **Automated optimization**: Consider using an open-source tool like AutoRAG or RAGBuilder to systematically test configurations. AutoRAG, for instance, can generate a QA evaluation set from your corpus and try different chunking strategies, embedding models, and prompt templates to find the best pipeline for your data.
- **Iterate on components**: Update the vector DB regularly if documents change. Re-embed and re-index as needed. Monitor for drift (if language or topics evolve, you may need new data). Because everything is open-source, you can retrain or fine-tune embedding models or LLMs on-domain data if necessary.

### 9. Summary of Key Steps
- **Ingest & parse** all document formats (PDF, Word, HTML, images) to extract text (using Docling/Unstructured/Tika + OCR).
- **Preprocess text** by cleaning noise and splitting into chunks (small enough for your LLM).
- **Embed chunks** with an open-source model (Sentence-Transformers or LLM-based) on GPU.
- **Store vectors** in a vector DB (Milvus or Chroma). Milvus for large-scale/high performance, Chroma for small/simple setups.
- **Serve queries**: embed the user’s query and perform a vector search to get top-k chunks.
Augment & generate: feed the retrieved chunks plus the query into an open-source LLM to generate the answer.
- **Orchestrate with Kafka/Kubernetes**: use Kafka topics to queue tasks between microservices (parsing, embedding, retrieval, LLM), and deploy each service on K8s for parallelism.
- **Evaluate and tune** each component (chunking strategy, embeddings, retrieval depth, LLM prompts) against held-out QA tests. Tools like AutoRAG can automate finding the best RAG configuration for your data.


By following these steps with open-source tools (Hugging Face models, LangChain/LlamaIndex frameworks, Milvus/Chroma, Kafka, etc.), you’ll build a fully open RAG pipeline. This system will leverage your 4×A100 GPUs for fast embedding and generation, use Kafka and Kubernetes for scalable orchestration, and iterate towards the optimal configuration of chunk size, embeddings, and LLM for your English-language documents.
